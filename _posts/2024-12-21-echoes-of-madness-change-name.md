After 4 months in pre-production, Team Kraken Hunters’ current project, previously known as "Echoes of Madness," will now be called "Flashes of Madness."

This decision was made due to the existence of other games with similar names, as well as the strong connection between the word "Flashes" and the game’s core mechanics. Even the cutscenes, which represent the protagonist's memories, align perfectly with the new name.

In addition to the name change, the game has received two new builds (one for Mac and another for Windows). The Team Kraken Hunters crew has named these updates Beta 2.0.

The new builds feature significant enhancements to the game’s art, as well as improvements to its systems and UI/UX design.

The studio now aims to generate organic traffic to test the project and gather community feedback, ensuring development aligns closely with players’ expectations.
