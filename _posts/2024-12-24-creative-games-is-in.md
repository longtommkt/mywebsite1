Starting January 1, 2025, Long Tom's content creator team will welcome Creative Games, a channel whose slogan is "A channel for hardcore gamers." For Brazilians, this symbolizes a focus on traditional gamers who enjoy iconic consoles and games.

Currently, the channel has 180,000 subscribers and a loyal audience that resonates with its creator's vision of the gaming industry.

Long Tom pursued this partnership with Creative Games because of the channel's potential and the belief that indie game studios need a vector like this to showcase their projects in the Brazilian market.

Below is an interview we conducted with Guilherme, the creator of Creative Games:

Good morning, Guilherme! We’re thrilled to have you on board. You’re actually the first member of our team, making you doubly special to us. Please introduce yourself to our audience (full name, age, city, state, and country):

My name is Guilherme, I’m 29 years old, and I live in Quatro Barras, a small town near Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil.
Tell us about your life before YouTube. What did you do before creating Creative Games?

I did a lot, but I stood out in the automotive field. I worked with machining, studied metrology, and operated CNC milling and turning machines in metalworking shops. I’m trained in CNC machine setup.
What are your hobbies, favorite sports, music, and movies?

Besides gaming (obviously, haha), I love nature. I enjoy getting out of the city, spending time in the countryside, and enjoying fresh air with friends. In music, I love classic rock, 80s and 90s songs, and old-school Brazilian country music. In movies, I’m a big fan of Christopher Nolan’s films, like Inception, Tenet, and Interstellar. For anime, Naruto has always been my philosophy of life (haha). My favorite series include Peaky Blinders, Sons of Anarchy, Supernatural, and Mr. Robot.
How did Creative Games come to life?

It started during the pandemic. I worked in logistics at Renault, but when everything shut down, I stayed home. I’ve always been a YouTube fan, watching channels like Zangado and BRKsEDU. But I wanted to create videos my way. My family is full of gamers, so I have tons of stories to tell. I also knew how to edit videos, as I did freelance work before. That’s how Creative Games was born.
What role do games play in your life and history?

I started gaming at 6 years old and learned so much—English, culture, history. Games teach you anything in a fun way and shield you from negativity in the world. They’ve changed my life.
What are your favorite game genres and titles? Is there one game you love the most? Why?

I love open-world exploration games with deep stories, like Zelda (my all-time favorite) and Red Dead Redemption. But I play a bit of everything.
What’s your view on the evolution of games and consoles, and where the industry is headed?

The technological evolution is incredible. For those of us from the 90s, it’s amazing to see how far we’ve come. But as an industry, we’re in an era of creativity shortage. Big productions prioritize profits over fun or the emotional connection older games offered. Today’s games are made for short-term consumers, not passionate players. My channel focuses on nostalgia for games, old and new, crafted with care and heart.
If you could create a game, what would it be like?

It would have a huge open world with endless possibilities, a grounded story mixing adventure and drama, and character customization to make the protagonist unique.
Quick questions:

Favorite console? Nintendo 64
Best game ever? Zelda: Ocarina of Time
Favorite character? Arthur Morgan
Best game-to-movie adaptation? Tomb Raider (Angelina Jolie nailed Lara Croft).
Currently playing? Dante’s Inferno and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
Final message to our audience:

Life is like a countdown that ends someday. Choose to spend your time doing what you love. Be the protagonist of your story, walk your own path, and never depend on anyone. It’s your life.
