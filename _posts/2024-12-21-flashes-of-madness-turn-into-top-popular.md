Even in its beta stage, without its demo version fully released, Flashes of Madness, developed by the indie studio Team Kraken Hunters, is already ranked among the most popular games in its genre and category. This achievement is far from superficial, as the platform currently hosts over 5,300 games.

The developers at Team Kraken Hunters dream big. Despite officially starting work on the game just three weeks ago, they have set some truly ambitious goals. They aim for the demo version of Flashes of Madness to rank among the top 10 bestsellers in its category on Itch.io, raise $200,000 USD through their crowdfunding campaign, and deliver a final version of the game with approximately three hours of gameplay by 2025.

The studioâ€™s vision is to become a beacon for other indie developers, creating a launch strategy that allows the company to achieve financial sustainability without relying on external funding.
