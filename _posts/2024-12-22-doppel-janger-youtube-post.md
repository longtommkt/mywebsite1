Doppel Janger is a new YouTuber on the platform. He primarily produces content about horror games, creating gameplay videos of indie titles in this genre and reacting authentically on his channel, providing a clear sense of the emotions and thoughts players will experience while playing the game.

On December 20, 2024, Doppel Janger posted a full gameplay video of Flashes of Madness (Beta 2.0 version) on his channel. The video was very well-produced and showcases the project's evolution since the first build released by Team Kraken Hunters.

Doppel Janger ended the video excited to see the game's future updates, clearly showing that the project is reaching its target audience as envisioned by TKH. The final version promises to deliver at least 3 hours of high-quality gameplay.

Long Tom will launch a large campaign in February 2025, involving over 50 content creators from different parts of the world to showcase the final demo version of Flashes of Madness, which will be sold on the studio's Itch.io page. We will likely see new Flashes of Madness gameplay videos posted on Doppel Janger's channel soon.
