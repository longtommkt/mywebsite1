I write this article with great joy, as I feel I am creating not just a company, but an organism that sustains itself and fosters cooperation and prosperity throughout the surrounding ecosystem. 

This is how I see the birth of Long Tom and Team Kraken Hunters as sister companies. While Team Kraken Hunters, as a studio, develops games using junior talent and trains the next generation of independent game developers, Long Tom transforms these games into competitive and popular products, simultaneously generating marketing and sales benchmarks for the entire gaming industry.

> I am already conducting the necessary research to "calibrate" Long Tomâ€™s aim and kick off this alliance with a direct hit through the launch of Echoes of Madness. I am confident that this journey will establish a series of high-efficiency standards and a game-launching methodology that will bring financial predictability to Team Kraken Hunters. 


We hope this journey becomes a milestone in the independent gaming industry and positively impacts the lives of all employees of both companies, while creating memorable games for our consumers around the globe.
