Long Tom is a Canadian company founded by a Brazilian game developer who saw a major opportunity to revolutionize the gaming industry. The vision is to break the bubble and target underexplored markets, connecting content creators with game studios. Given the founder's Brazilian roots, it’s only natural to start by tapping into the potential of his home country.

From its population of over 212 million, Brazil boasts an impressive 73.9% identifying as gamers. That’s over 157 million players who, unfortunately, are currently underserved with high-quality content about games produced in North America.

Also, consider the significant disparity in game marketing campaigns between North and South America. This imbalance leads to an overvaluation of efforts in the North while neglecting the South, presenting a cost-effective opportunity for studios to significantly boost their sales volume by investing far less in the Brazilian market compared to northern regions.

With over 17 years of commercial experience and a physical presence in both Canada and Brazil, Daril and Miguel Camilo are the driving forces behind Long Tom. Known for their bold and aggressive approach to business, they continuously expand their network and negotiate fearlessly, taking full responsibility for delivering results. Together, they have crafted Long Tom into the ultimate marketing weapon to elevate your game studio's sales to the next level.
